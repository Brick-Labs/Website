# Website

This website should be the focal point of the Brick Labs community, where various programs are made available for download and users can share their own creations.

## Requirements
All functional and non-functional requirements are listed below in the form of check boxes to provide an overview of what has already been implemented.

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Different Versions of Every released Program should be shown and downloadable.
- [ ] Users must be able to create an account and log in with it; there should be a quick registration feature via Google.
- [ ] Users should be able to upload their built models and present them with pictures on the website under ‘Creations’. The preview image of the post should like a brick set in a packaging.
- [ ] For each Post, you should be able to upload a certain number of images that together provide a 360-degree view of the model.
